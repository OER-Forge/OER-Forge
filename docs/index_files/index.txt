Build, share, and improve WCAG-compliant Open Educational Resources with
Python!

Welcome

OER-Forge is an open source Python toolkit for building, organizing, and
publishing accessible Open Educational Resources (OERs). Our goal: make
it easy and fun to create sites and documents that meet WCAG standards.

- Accessible by design: All templates and outputs aim for WCAG
  compliance.
- Database-driven navigation: Section indices, menus, and hierarchy are
  managed in SQLite for robust, extensible site structure.
- Multi-format input: Write content in Markdown, DOCX, and Jupyter
  Notebooks.
- Multi-format export: Markdown, DOCX, PDF, LaTeX, and TXT.
- (optional) Validation using Pa11y: Automated checks and open reporting
  during and after build to ensure compliance. Pa11y on GitHub
