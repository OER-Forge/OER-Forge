OER-Forge

Build, share, and improve WCAG-compliant Open Educational Resources with Python!

Welcome

OER-Forge is an open source Python toolkit for building, organizing, and publishing accessible Open Educational Resources (OERs). Our goal: make it easy and fun to create sites and documents that meet WCAG standards.

Accessible by design: All templates and outputs aim for WCAG compliance.


Database-driven navigation: Section indices, menus, and hierarchy are managed in SQLite for robust, extensible site structure.


Multi-format export: Markdown, DOCX, PDF, LaTeX, and more.


Built for maintainers: Clean Code, SOLID principles, and a growing suite of tests.


Fun to hack: Professional, but not boring. ☕️❤️
