Introduction to Newton's Laws of Motion

Physics is the study of matter, energy, and the interactions between them. In this lesson, we'll explore Newton's Laws of Motion.

Newton's First Law

An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force.

Also known as the Law of Inertia.


Example: A book on a table remains at rest unless pushed.


Newton's Second Law

Newton's Second Law relates force, mass, and acceleration:

$$F = m \cdot a$$

Where:

$F$ = Force (Newtons)


$m$ = Mass (kg)


$a$ = Acceleration ($m/s^2$)
