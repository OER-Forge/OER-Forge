## Newton's First Law

> An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force.

- Also known as the **Law of Inertia**.
- Example: A book on a table remains at rest unless pushed.

## Newton's Second Law

Newton's Second Law relates force, mass, and acceleration:

$$
F = m \cdot a
$$

Where:
- $F$ = Force (Newtons)
- $m$ = Mass (kg)
- $a$ = Acceleration ($m/s^2$)

**Example Calculation:**
