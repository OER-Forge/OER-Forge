Newton’s First Law

  An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in
  motion unless acted upon by an external force.

- Also known as the Law of Inertia.
- Example: A book on a table remains at rest unless pushed.

Newton’s Second Law

Newton’s Second Law relates force, mass, and acceleration:

F = m ⋅ a

Where: - F = Force (Newtons) - m = Mass (kg) - a = Acceleration (m/s²)

Example Calculation:
