  **Build, share, and improve WCAG-compliant Open Educational Resources with Python!**
</div>

## Overview

OER-Forge is an open source Python toolkit for building, organizing, and publishing accessible Open Educational Resources (OERs). It helps authors create sites and documents that meet [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) standards, with a focus on clean code, extensibility, and fun!

- **Accessible by design:** All templates and outputs aim for [WCAG compliance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).
- **Database-driven navigation:** Section indices, menus, and hierarchy are managed in SQLite for robust, extensible site structure.
- **Multi-format export:** Markdown, DOCX, PDF, LaTeX, and more.
- **Built for maintainers:** Clean Code, SOLID principles, and a growing suite of tests.
- **Fun to hack:** Professional, but not boring. ‚òïÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/OER-Forge/OER-Forge.git
   cd OER-Forge
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Build the site:**
   ```sh
   python build.py
   ```
4. **View your site:**
   Open `build/index.html` in your browser.

## Features

- **Section indices & navigation:** DB-driven, supports arbitrary hierarchy, top-level and nested menus.
- **Accessibility:** ARIA labels, alt text, color contrast, keyboard navigation.
- **Download options:** Export pages in multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.).
- **Dark mode:** Toggle theme for better readability ([issue #3](https://github.com/OER-Forge/OER-Forge/issues/3)).
- **Inline figures:** Markdown images with alt text for accessibility ([issue #4](https://github.com/OER-Forge/OER-Forge/issues/4)).
- **Extensible templates:** Jinja2-based, easy to customize.
- **Robust build system:** Automated, logs to `log/` for debugging.

# OER-Forge Build & Robustness Checklist

_Last updated: 2025-07-18_

## 1. Build Pipeline
- [ ] Run `python make.py` to build the site and generate all outputs.
- [ ] Confirm all Markdown (.md) files are converted to all requested formats (PDF, DOCX, LaTeX, EPUB, TXT, etc.).
- [ ] Check that images in Markdown files appear in DOCX, PDF, and LaTeX outputs.
- [ ] Ensure all outputs are placed in the correct section-local directories (next to `index.html` and in `files/` as needed).
- [ ] Remove any duplicate or stub converter functions in `convert.py`.
- [ ] Clean up debug prints and stub counters in production code.

## 2. Accessibility (WCAG) Verification
- [ ] Run `verify.py` on all generated HTML files.
- [ ] Log accessibility results in the database.
- [ ] Inject accessibility badges/labels into HTML pages.
- [ ] Generate and link per-page accessibility reports.
- [ ] Summarize accessibility results in the admin/build report.

## 3. Admin Pages & Reporting
- [ ] Implement or update `build/admin/index.html` to summarize all build and accessibility results.
- [ ] Include links to all outputs and per-page accessibility reports.
- [ ] Ensure the admin report is accessible and easy to scan.

## 4. Robustness & Cleanup
- [ ] Remove obsolete outputs from `build/` to match the current export plan.
- [ ] Ensure repeated builds do not leave stale files or DB records.
- [ ] Log all errors and reasons for failed conversions or checks (do not block build).

## 5. CLI & User Experience
- [ ] Add CLI options for `--dry-run`, `--force`, and `--report` in `make.py`.
- [ ] Ensure CLI is intuitive and safe (no destructive actions in dry-run mode).
- [ ] Print build and accessibility summaries to console and write to admin report.

## 6. Documentation & Extensibility
- [ ] Update README and in-code documentation to reflect the current pipeline, config, and output structure.
- [ ] Document all new database fields and config options for future maintainers.
- [ ] Ensure the system is extensible for new export types, accessibility tools, or reporting features.

## 7. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test all conversions and accessibility checks with real content, including edge cases (images, custom paths, forced conversions).
- [ ] Move or refactor sections and confirm all internal links and assets remain valid.
- [ ] Run repeated builds with config changes to ensure robustness.

---

**Tip:** Work through this checklist after every major refactor or before a release to ensure OER-Forge remains robust, accessible, and maintainable.
